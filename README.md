# easyEtymologyB2P: Yet Another Work in Progress: May 2018

## A Website for the Etymologist or Anyone Who Loves Words

* Built with HTML, CSS, Materialize, JavaScript, a Jasen Hill 'MP3 Word Pronunciation API', and a CJ.R 'An Etymological English Words API', tested with Cypress, and deployed with Surge.

* This site was deployed in January 2018 and is the second website I built while in a six month web development immersion program at Galvanize Inc. Instead of cleaning up the code, I have left it as is so that one can view the progression of my work throughout the last six months.

* To view the website EasyEtymology, visit: <https://easyetymology.surge.sh/>

* Use the search bar to enter an English word.

* By clicking the sound icon (the head), one can hear the pronunciation of the generated word.

* To run this locally, clone the repository, and run lite-server, live-server, or use npm run dev in the terminal.
